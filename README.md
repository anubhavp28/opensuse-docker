# OpenSUSE + Docker
Recipe for openSUSE based docker images of open source softwares.

I have created openSUSE based docker images of open source softwares. **I have integrated Jenkins (hosted on AWS at http://18.233.0.120:8080/) to build docker images on every commit to the repo.**

Docker images can be found at https://hub.docker.com/u/anubhavp .

I can also provide login credentials to Jenkins, if you want to examine my Jenkins setup.
